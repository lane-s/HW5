<!-- Things that still are (probably) broken:

Normals seem incorrect in some cases

Operations sometimes result in artifacts:

I've seen some weird black triangles after some union operations

the LEAF - LEAF case for the diff operation seems to calculate jagged edges when used with the surface of the perlin heightmap. 
Could be something wrong with the hermite data for the noise function since I haven't seen it happen with other types of volume data.

<!-- 
Possible improvements:

Try using other methods to find the intersection point for different density functions. Interpolation, binary search both could come in handy

Raycast from mouse to place brush

Rotate brush

Intersection operation

Replacement operation (like painting)

Operations on octrees with different sized leaves (allows operations on simplified octrees)

Buffered geometry for fast csg operations

Write a shader to blend between materials, use material textures

Chunk loading, seam stitching (allows for LOD with far away chunks)

Top-down lighting

Collision detection -->
